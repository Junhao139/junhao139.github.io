# Lost - Maroon 5

Maroon 5 的《Lost》蛮好听的，翻译一下。



> 每句歌词有三行，一行原文，一行翻译，一行供翻唱。



Got no connection, no faith or direction, no 12

没有思绪，没有信念或希望

脑海里空空，前进的步伐沉重

Searching and searching for someone to save my soul, ooh

不停寻找某个容纳灵魂的寄托

焦躁地搜索某个心灵的住所

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

喔——喔——，喔——喔——

I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave 12

我被卷入到海浪中，无法回头

尝试逃入那出口，发现已是封锁

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

喔——喔——，喔——喔——

Then I heard you say my name 7

直到我的耳边响起你的传唤

突然你向我伸手

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

耶——，耶——



Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me

迷失，我曾迷失，直到你爱上了我

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found

而现在我被找到，被解救，获自由

Yeah, you took me to a place

对，你带领我到了一处秘境

It was safe, it was sound (sound-sound-sound)

那里远离危险，坚固而安全

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found



Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found

Yeah, you took me to a place

It was safe, it was sound (sound-sound-sound)

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found



I was so broken, my heart was an empty space (oh, oh, oh)

Life was a joke 'til the moment I saw your face

Saw your face, saw your face



Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Then I heard you say my name

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah



Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found

Yeah, you took me to a place

It was safe, it was sound (sound-sound-sound)

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found



Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found

Yeah, you took me to a place

It was safe, it was sound (sound-sound-sound)

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found



Ooh-ooh-ooh, again (ah-ah)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, again, yeah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, again (ah-ah)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, again, yeah



Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I was stranded when you came

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (now I'm found, found, found)

Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found (oh yeah)

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)

Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (now I'm found, found, found)

Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (ooh, yeah, yeah)

Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
