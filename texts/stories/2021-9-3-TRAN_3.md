# 翻译挑战三：《带上她的眼睛》—— 刘慈欣（一）

总是找一些新闻虽然能增长见识，但未免有些无趣。

__这次做两个反转：首先从西-中变为英-中；其次，从翻译成中文变为翻译成外文。__

那怎么知道我翻译的是不是一派乱文呢？因为是英语呀，北鼻（Baby）。

本次翻译的是《带上她的眼睛》，作者为大刘（刘慈欣）。本人英语水平不好，请不要评论我毁了原文的本意。

### 《带上她的眼睛》—— 刘慈欣

__《Bring her eyes》By CiXin Liu__

> 连续工作了两个多月，我实在累了，便请求主任给我两天假，出去短暂旅游一下散散心。主任答应了，条件是我再带一双眼睛去，我也答应了，于是他带我去拿眼睛。

Have already been working for about 2 months, honestly, I feel tired. So I asked my director for a few holidays, to take a short journey to ralax a bit. He was agree, but required me to take a pair of Eyes. I have agreed as well, so he took me there to bring some Eyes.

> 眼睛放在控制中心走廊尽头的一个小房间里，现在还剩下十几双。

The Eyes are put inside a little room at the end of the corridor of the Control Center. There are about less than twenty left.

> 主任递给我一双眼睛，指指前面的大屏幕，把眼睛的主人介绍给我，是一个好象刚毕业的小姑娘，呆呆地看着我。在肥大的太空服中，她更显得娇小，一副可怜兮兮的样子，显然刚刚体会到太空不是她在大学图书馆中想象的浪漫天堂，某些方面可能比地狱还稍差些。

The director gave me a pair of Eyes, pointing to the front screen, introducing me the owner of those Eyes. She seemed to be a little girl who has just finished University, staring blankly at me. She looks tiny, and a bit poor inside the loosy spacesuit. Apparently, she has just felt that the space world is not as romantic as she imagined in the library of her University, however, it might be worse than the hell.

> “麻烦您了，真不好意思。”她连连向我鞠躬，这是我听到过的最轻柔的声音，我想象着这声音从外太空飘来，象一阵微风吹过轨道上那些庞大粗陋的钢结构，使它们立刻变得象橡皮泥一样软。

\- Excuse me of troubling you. - She bowed to me repeatly. That's the most gentle voice I've ever heard. I was imagining as if the voice came from the outer-space, fluttering, like a soft wind caressing those bulky steel stuctures of the railway, and suddenly made them as soft as a piece of plasticine.

> “一点都不，我很高兴有个伴儿的。你想去那儿？”我豪爽地说。

\- Nevermind, I'm glad of having a travel mate. Where do you wanna go? - I said it straightforwardly.

> “什么？您自己还没决定去哪儿？”她看上去很高兴。但我立刻感到两个异样的地方，其一，地面与外太空通讯都有延时，即使在月球，延时也有两秒钟，小行星带延时更长，但她的回答几乎感觉不到延时，这就是说，她现在在近地轨道，那里回地面不用中转，费用和时间都不需多少，没必要托别人带眼睛去渡假。其二是她身上的太空服，做为航天个人装备工程师，我觉得这种太空服很奇怪：在服装上看不到防辐射系统，放在她旁边的头盔的面罩上也没有强光防护系统；我还注意到，这套服装的隔热和冷却系统异常发达。

\- What? Haven't you decided where to go? - She seemed to be really happy. But I suddenly felt 2 strange points: one, there's always a delay between communications Earth and Outer-space, even if she is on the moon, the delay must be about 2 seconds, and it must be longer if she is an the asteroides, but I didn't find almost any delay in her responses. Which means, she's in the close-up orbit, but there's no transits at going back to the earth, neither must costs nor times, it has no necessities of making favours to others to travel; Two, is the space suit which she's wearing, as being a space personal equipment engineer, I think this kind of spece suit is rare: no anti-radiation system seen on the suit, no strong-light protection system on the mask in the helmet next to her; finally, the heat isulation and cooling systems are unexpected really developed.

> “她在哪个空间站？”我扭头问主任。

\- Which space station is she staying in? - I turned the head to ask the director.

> “先别问这个吧。”主任的脸色很阴沉。

\- Don't ask it now. - The director's face darkens.

> “别问好吗？”屏幕上的她也说，还是那副让人心软的小可怜样儿。

 \- Could you please don't ask it? - She was also telling it from the sreen, still an poor aspect that soften me up.

> “你不会是被关禁闭吧？”我开玩笑说，因为她所在的舱室十分窄小，显然是一个航行体的驾驶舱，各种复杂的导航系统此起彼伏地闪烁着，但没有窗子，也没有观察屏幕，只有一支在她头顶打转的失重的铅笔说明她是在太空中。听了我的话，她和主任似乎都愣了一下，我赶紧说：“好，我不问自己不该知道的事了，你还是决定我们去哪儿吧。

\- Wouldn't you are in the black room, eh? - I joked. Because the room where she is was really narrow. Apparently, it's the flight deck of a flying object, there're lots of complex navigation systems' lights flickering unorderedly. But there aren't any windows, neither the lookout, but a self-rotating antigravitatory pencil explaining that she's genuinely in the outer-space. After hearing my words, both she and the director staggered a bit. I hasty said: "OK. I won't ask those unrelated things anymore, but you could decide where we'll go now."

> 这个决定对她很艰难，她的双手在太空服的手套里握在胸前，双眼半闭着，似乎是在决定生存还是死亡，或者认为地球在我们这次短暂的旅行后就要爆炸了。我不由笑出声来。

This decision seemed difficult for her. Her hands, inside spacesuit gloves, holding each other in front of chest, with half-closed eyes, looks like deciding between live and death, or maybe the Earth is going to explode after the travel. I laughed unintentionally.

> “哦，这对我来说不容易，您要是看过海伦·凯勒的《三天所见》的话，就能明白这多难了！”

\- Oh, it's not a easy question for me. If you've ever read Helen's Three Days To See, you'll know how difficult it is!

> “我们没有三天，只有两天。在时间上，这个时代的人都是穷光蛋。但比那个二十世纪盲人的幸运的是，我和你的眼晴在三小时内可到达地球的仍何一个地方。”

\- We don't have three days, only two. In the case of time, everyone of this era are beggars. However, what we're luckier than the 20 century's blinds is, our eyes can reach whatever place around the world in 3 hours.

> “那就去我们起航前去过的地方吧！”她告诉了我那个地方，于是我带着她的眼睛去了。

\- Then let's go to the place where we've been before we set off! - She told me about that place, therefore I brought her eyes go.
