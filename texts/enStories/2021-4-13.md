# Surprise!

Just boring.

### Surprise!

“Morning! Alice? Wake up, my dear~” Mom’s voice appeared tenderly around Alice’s ears.

“Uh, ” Alice opened her eyes, saw an unexpected dark. But that’s not deep darkness, but an unstable orange light bright on the wall. “What’s going on?” She turned her head in the direction where the voice came.

“Woowhhhhh-” She screamed.

“Surprise!”

In front of her, is a white, rounded cake, with some candles on it, lighting the whole cake, and also on both a tender face and a surprising face.

“Haha, I see your happiness. I would take a photo if my phone is here. Wish a dream then blow them all!”

Alice put her hands together and closed her eyes. About a moment later, she blew them all off.

The entire room fell into a deep dark. She can’t see anything until a strident alarm noise came into her ears. She got up, closed the alarm, stared at the table. When she’s finally used to the light, she came to her mind: she is left. Since years ago.
